# MineSweeper
The classic game of MineSweeper made with Python and the Pyglet module.

## Requirements
For source code downloads, I test my programs on 3.7.8, so that version and later should definitely work. But Python 3.0 and up on paper on paper should work. 
On the other hand, if you downloaded a .EXE (Windows) file or .APP (Mac File), it should work, as long as you download the right one.
## Installation
First, download the source code. You can do this by clicking the green download button on the repo website or if you have Git installed, run this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/lectri/MineSweeper/
```
After that, you must install the pyglet module. This can be done with the following command:
```
py -m pip install Pyglet
```
Finally, run `main.py` and you'll be able to play.

If there is a roadblock trying to play, let me know by creating a descriptive issue of the problem.
### Release Installation
A release installation is installed by going to the 'releases' side of the repository. Click the download that corresponds to your OS, or download the source code.
